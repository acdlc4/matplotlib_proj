# matplotlib_proj

Using Matplotlib, the purpose of this project is to analyze a data set involving a fictional mouse study run by a new pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, Inc., that specializes in anti-cancer medications.  Over a testing period of 45 days, range of different drug regimens were administered to 249 mice.  Pymaceuticals' drug, Capomulin, is being compared to the other drug regimens to see whether it is as, or more, effective than the competition. 

Factors involved in the analysis include the following (below list is not exhaustive):

    - No control subjects data was provided (i.e. data from mice that were not provided with a drug regimen).
    - All data mouse subjects had a starting tumor volume of 45 mm3.
    - No further information provided as to why certain subjects had incomplete data.
